# Couple Intimacy Check-In
A simple worksheet to help couples explore how they feel about intimacy in a calm and structured way.


### **Purpose**

Create a regular, low-pressure moment to check in about intimacy, connection, and how things feel right now, without needing to fix or decide anything immediately.

---

### **1) How I feel about our intimacy lately**

- 

---

### **2) What feels good or supportive right now**

- 

---

### **3) What feels a bit off, missing, or unclear**

- 

---

### **4) My current level of openness**

(Check what fits best)

- [ ]  I feel open and curious
- [ ]  I feel neutral / unsure
- [ ]  I feel a bit closed or tired
- [ ]  I don’t really know yet

---

### **5) What I’d like more of (not a demand)**

- 

---

### **6) What I’d like less of (or a pause from)**

- 

---

### **7) One small thing that would help right now**

- 

---

### **Note**

This check-in is about noticing and sharing, not negotiating or solving everything at once.

We originally created this worksheet for ourselves.

Over time, we turned it into a small app to make comparison and discussion easier, while keeping everything private and pressure free : [https://yes-no-maybe.app](https://yes-no-maybe.app/)
