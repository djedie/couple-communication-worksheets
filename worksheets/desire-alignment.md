# Desire Alignment (Yes/No/Maybe)

### **Purpose**

Identify where desires overlap, where they differ, and where curiosity exists, without pressure to act or agree.

### **1) Desires I feel clear about right now**

- 

---

### **2) Desires I feel unsure or curious about**

- 

---

### **3) Desires that don’t feel right for me (at the moment)**

---

### **4) What “Maybe” means for me today**

(Check what applies)

- [ ]  I need more information

---

### **6) What makes alignment harder for me**

*Note*

We originally created this worksheet for ourselves.

Over time, we turned it into a small app to make comparison and discussion easier, while keeping everything private and pressure free : [https://yes-no-maybe.app](https://yes-no-maybe.app/)
