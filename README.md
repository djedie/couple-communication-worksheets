# Couple Communication Worksheets

This repository contains simple, non-explicit worksheets designed to help couples talk about desire, boundaries, and intimacy in a calm and structured way.

They are meant to be used as conversation starters, not as prescriptions or checklists to “perform correctly”.

## Why these worksheets exist

Many couples struggle to talk about intimacy not because they lack desire, but because conversations feel loaded, awkward, or risky.

Writing things down first:
- lowers emotional pressure
- allows reflection without immediate response
- creates space for honest, nuanced answers

These worksheets are intentionally simple, neutral, and adaptable.

## How to use these worksheets

There is no “right” way.

Some couples:
- fill them independently, then compare
- use them as journaling prompts
- revisit the same worksheet over time

The goal is not agreement, but understanding.

## About the project

These worksheets are part of a broader reflection on how couples talk about intimacy.

They eventually inspired a small private web app called **Yes · No · Maybe**, which turns these written frameworks into a shared, private space couples can revisit over time.
